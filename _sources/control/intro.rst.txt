Control file
************

The program control data file is an ASCII file containing Fortran 90
namelist input. The template for this file is:

:nl:nl:`&RunSpecification`
    Run time specifications, compulsory
:nl:nl:`&GlobalResource`
    Program resources & configuration, compulsory

:nl:nl:`&GlobalSettings`

:nl:nl:`&NetCDFImport`
    Attributes of NetCDF imported file, 0 or 1 occurence
:nl:nl:`&InspectSpecification`
    Attributes of INSPECT ouput, 0 or 1 occurence
:nl:nl:`&ModelSpecification`
    Model specifications, at least 1 occurence
:nl:nl:`&Process`
    Operations to perform, 0 or more occurences


All Fortran 90 standard rules for namelist input apply, e.g.

- Character strings do not need quotes if they do not contain blanks
- Everything except character strings is case insensitive.
- Ordering within a namelist block is free.
- One line can contain several items, separated by blanks or commas.
- Each block must be terminated by a slash.

Double check your namelist! Although a lot of effort has been invested
to control the consistency of the user defined parameters, mistakes in
the formatting of the namelist may have unexpected consequences.


In the following chapters, all namelist objects are described in
details. A table listing in a compact form all the namelist objects
together with their default values is available in chapter 14.
