Description of tools
********************

To simplify the use of fieldextra for some common tasks, a set of so-called fx tools
are provided. Each of these tools is a wrapper script, which accepts a limited set 
of arguments, and use fieldextra as computation engine. The fieldextra namelist is
generated on the fly by the wrapper script, depending on the specified arguments.

The following tools are found in the ./tools subdirectory of the distribution package:

*  grins

  This program lists the table of content of the specified GRIB file.
  Different type of information can be displayed, according to the
  value of OPTIONS. A specific record can be selected.
  Without options, record number, field name, level, initial date, and
  time are printed.

*  fxclone

  This program makes a copy of the specified GRIB file, modifying the
  global attributes of each record according to the specified options.

*  fxdestagger

  This program de-stagger all fields found in input file, making a
  copy of the input file containg all original fields, but interpolated
  on the grid associated with the specified reference field.

*  fxfilter

  This program filters the records found in the specified GRIB file on
  the basis of the specified options.

*  fxcrop

  This program crops all the records of the specified GRIB file to the
  specified subdomain.

*  fxconvert

  This program converts the specified GRIB file to the specified format;
  the output format GRIB 1, GRIB 2, and NetCDF are supported.

More details on each tool can be obtained by calling the tool with the
option --help .



Other tools are also available for some special requirements:

* fx_upscaling
  (require Python 3.6)

  A wrapper script is provided for the complex upscaling task applied at
  MeteoSwiss to upscale the whole model output from the 1.1 km grid to a
  collocated 2.2 km grid.
* nl_rendering
  (require Python 3.6 and the jinja2 template designer)

  Complex namelist defining many products at the same time may be difficult to
  edit and to debug. The nl_rendering tool supports organizing complex namelists 
  in a hierarchical way; the tool generates a pure Fortran namelist from the
  structured definition.
