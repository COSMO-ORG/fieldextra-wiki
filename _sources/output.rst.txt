****************************
Description of output format
****************************

.. _section 7.1:
 
INCORE
======

Pseudo output type used as global internal storage.
See description of 'out_type' for further information.

.. _section 7.2:

INSPECT
=======

Pseudo output type used to extract the characteristics of the records contained
in the associated input files. 

The information produced is defined by the settings in &InspectSpecification
and is stored in ASCII file fieldextra.inspect, in current working directory. 

If select_record is not set (or is 0), information on all records found in input
files is produced.

For each record, the information is displayed as a set of lines and of multi-lines
blocks. Multi-lines blocks are used for : print_rec_vcoord, select_data_column (if
not used with select_data_row), select_data_row (if not used with select_data_column),
print_rec_data. A single information line is used for each of : print_rec_pds,
print_rec_gds, print_experiment_version, print_rec_format. All remaining information
is packed in a single line.

When the only output in a namelist is the INSPECT pseudo-output, fewer consistency
checks are performed in fieldextra and field transcoding is inactive. This supports
a more transparent inspection of the input records. A contrario, this means that the
INSPECT output produced in combination with other output reports interpreted values.

.. _section 7.3:

N_TUPLE
=======

Spezialized ASCII output, line oriented, each line representing an event (multiple
fields at a single point). Coupled with the use of the *_filter operators supports
examining the model sub-space defined by some conditions on the model fields (e.g.
find the locations where a certain amount of super-saturation is achieved).

Conditions for using this format:
(1) all fields are available on the same set of levels with same level type, OR
    all fields are single level fields,                                      OR
    all multi-level fields are available on a single common level.
(2) all fields are uniquely defined by name and level information.

Depending on the mix of single and multiple level fields, an n-tuple is
composed by:
all available fields at a specified lat/lon/level and time,
    when only multi-level fields are available;
all available fields at a specified lat/lon and time,
    when single level fields are present.

N-tuples containing undefined values are skipped.

The following options are supported: out_type_snapshot, out_type_replace,
out_type_mapcst, out_type_fmt, out_type_undefcode, out_type_alternate_name,
out_type_nousetag, out_type_prodinfo, out_type_stdlongitude, out_cost.

The following limitations on the usage of this output are:
> slice not suported
> all fields must represent the same product, and not be probability fields
> EPS members must be from the same member
> staggered fields are not supported (re-grid fields if necessary)

.. _section 7.4:

METEOG
======

Spezialized ASCII output to list the temporal evolution of a single parameter 
at selected locations.

The following options are supported: out_type_snapshot, out_type_mapcst,
out_type_fmt, out_type_text1, out_type_text2, out_cost.

The following limitations on the usage of this output are:
> locations list is required
> staggered fields are not supported (re-grid fields if necessary)
> all fields must represent the same product
> EPS members must be from the same member
> the temporal resolution of the output must not be smaller than one hour

.. _section 7.5:

ASCII_TABLE
===========

Generic ASCII output, table oriented, with columns indexed by location and/or
field. ASCI_TABLE output is by default expressed as csv separated data and can 
easily be read by MS Excel or automatic routines.

Should be used instead of DAT_TABLE, FLD_TABLE and XLS_TABLE for location based
output. When the output is defined on a rectangular (sub-)domain, use BLK_TABLE
instead.

Five options for the arrangement of output values are possible; the option
is choosen by the namelist out_type_line_label:
location_time       = one new line for each location and each validation
                        time (outer loop on location), different fields in
                        different columns
time_location       = one new line for each location and each validation
                        time (outer loop on time), different fields in
                        different columns
time_location_level = one new line for each location, each validation time
                        and each level (outer loop on time, inner loop on 
                        levels), different fields (incl. EPS / pdf infos)
                        in different columns; requires unique set of levels
field_time          = one new line for each field and each validation
                        time (outer loop on field), different locations in
                        different columns
time_field          = one new line for each field and each validation
                        time (outer loop on time), different locations in
                        different columns
time                = one new line for each validation time, one new column
                        for each location and each validation time (outer loop
                        on locations)
Default value is "location_time".

In addition, four options for the file header can be chosen, controlled by
namelist out_type_legend:
none     = no header at all
standard = standard header
detailed = currently same as "standard"
extra    = minimal header in data file, full header as extra file
Default value is "none" (if out_type_line_label is not set or
out_type_line_label=location_time) or "standard" otherwise.


Multiple aspects of the output can be tailored by using one of the
supported out_type_* (see below).

When defined, the tag instead of the name of the field is used (this
behaviour can be changed by setting out_type_nousetag to true).

The following options are supported: out_type_snapshot, out_type_mapcst,
out_type_line_label, out_type_legend, out_type_separator, out_type_fmt,
out_type_pdfinfo, out_type_epsminfo, out_type_locinfo,
out_type_undefcode, out_type_text1, out_type_text2, out_type_stdlongitude,
out_type_fusedt, out_type_alternate_name, out_type_nousetag, out_cost.

The following limitations on the usage of this output are:
> grid points or locations list is required
> staggered fields are not supported (re-grid fields if necessary)

.. _section 7.6:

FLD_TABLE (obsolete)
====================

Generic ASCII output, table oriented, with columns indexed by fields descriptor.

The number of columns is defined by the repetitor of the format expressed 
in out_type_fmt, or is 12 when no repetitor is present. When more data
than the number of columns is present, lines are wrapped.

The following options are supported: out_type_snapshot, out_type_verbosity,
out_type_dwhhack, out_type_mminfo, out_type_pdfinfo, out_type_epsminfo,
out_type_mapcst, out_type_fmt, out_type_undefcode, out_type_file_header,
out_type_text1, out_type_stdlongitude, out_type_alternate_name,
out_type_nousetag, out_cost.

The following limitations on the usage of this output are:
> grid points or locations list is required
> staggered fields are not supported (re-grid fields if necessary)

.. _section 7.7:

DAT_TABLE (obsolete)
====================

Generic ASCII output, table oriented, with columns indexed by validation dates.

The number of columns is defined by the repetitor of the format expressed
in out_type_fmt, or is 12 when no repetitor is present. When more data
than the number of columns is present, lines are wrapped.

The following options are supported: out_type_snapshot, out_type_verbosity,
out_type_mminfo, out_type_pdfinfo, out_type_epsminfo, out_type_mapcst, 
out_type_fmt, out_type_undefcode, out_type_file_header, out_type_text1,
out_type_stdlongitude, out_type_alternate_name, out_type_nousetag, out_cost.

The following limitations on the usage of this output are:
> grid points or locations list is required
> staggered fields are not supported (re-grid fields if necessary)

.. _section 7.8:

XLS_TABLE (obsolete)
====================

Generic ASCII output, table oriented, with columns indexed by location or
by location and field.

XLS_TABLE output can either be expressed as MS Excel compatible csv
data, or as column oriented fixed format data. The active variant is
defined by the value of <out_type_separator>. Moreover, the csv variant
supports additional customizing.

When present, the tag instead of the name of the field is used in the file
header. In the fixed format option, the width of the field used for this
information is set to the minimum value not producing any truncation.

The following options are supported: out_type_snapshot, out_type_verbosity,
out_type_depreciated, out_type_pdfinfo, out_type_epsminfo, out_type_mminfo, 
out_type_prodinfo, out_type_noundef, out_type_dupcst, out_type_mapcst, out_type_fmt,
out_type_separator, out_type_cheader, out_type_fusedt, out_type_locinfo,
out_type_undefcode, out_type_file_header, out_type_text1, out_type_stdlongitude, 
out_type_alternate_name, out_type_nousetag, out_cost.

The following limitations on the usage of this output are:
> slice not suported
> all fields must represent the same product
> staggered fields are not supported (re-grid fields if necessary)

.. _section 7.9:

BLK_TABLE
=========

Generic ASCII output, block oriented, suited for listing sections of 2D fields.

Each 2D field is printed in a single multi-lines block. The number of values per
line is defined by the repetitor in out_type_fmt value. Per default the order of
the values in a multi-lines block is the same as in the input data, but can be
modified by setting out_type_scanmode.

Each multi-lines block is preceded by a one line header defining the data.
When present the tag instead of the name of the field is used in this header.

A main header defining some common characteristics is produced at the start
of the file. Each line of the main header follows the pattern "key: value".

For a given field, validation dates for which the field has never been defined
are skipped.

Verbosity level in {0, 1, 2, 3 4} is supported:
> verbosity 1: add information on data dimension, data format, missing value
            code, grid size in main header;
> verbosity 2: add information on horizontal coordinates in main header, add
            information on type of statistical processing, number of EPS
            members in block header;
> verbosity 3: add information on vertical coordinates in main header;
> verbosity 4: add information on extracted and printed fields in main header.

The format of the block header for the highest verbosity is:
> option +mminfo set :
YYYY MM DD HH mm tri stime etime field_tag field_level model_type product_cat
> option +mminfo not set :
YYYY MM DD HH tri stime etime field_tag field_level model_type product_cat
where:
YYYY MM DD HH mm  is the validation date
tri stime etime   is the type of statistical processing, the start of
                    the time interval, and the end of the time interval;
                    expressed in minute when option +mminfo is set, in
                    hour otherwise
field_tag         is the field tag, as specified in the namelist, or 
                    the field short name, as specified in the dictionary
field_level       is the field level, abbreviated as nnnnnCCCC, or -1
                    for surface fields or unrecognized level, with nnnn
                    the level value, and CCCC the level type :
                        gk    generalized height
                        k    hybrid level
                        hPa    pressure level, in [hPa]
                    masl    height above mean sea level, in [m]
                    magl    height above ground level, in [m]
                        tt    constant temperature, in [cK]
                        th    constant potential temperature, in [cK]
                        pv    constant PV level, units in [mPVU]
                        den    constant density level, units in [mugm-3] (10**-6 g/m**3)
model_type        model type (e.g. cosmo, ifs)
product_cat       product category (e.g. determinist, eps_member)

The following options are supported: out_type_snapshot, out_type_justontime,
out_type_replace, out_type_dupcst, out_type_mapcst, out_type_noundef, out_type_fmt,
out_type_file_header, out_type_text1, out_type_depreciated, 
out_type_scanmode, out_type_verbosity, out_type_mminfo, out_type_prodinfo,
out_type_alternate_name, out_type_nousetag, out_type_stdlongitude,
out_type_undefcode (can be overriden on a field basis with set_undefcode),
out_cost.

The following limitations on the usage of this output are:
> (verbosity < 1) all fields must represent the same product
> slice not suported
> when a domain subset is specified via a list of grid points or locations,
or a via a frame, the output is computed on the smallest possible compact
subdomain containing the specified subset, and values at supplementary
points are set to undefined.

.. _section 7.10:

TMPL_BASE 
=========

Generic ASCII output, based on a pre-defined template.
May be used in particular for creating XML files.

Output is produced by replacing data containers in a user specified template.
The template can be any file, and is declared via the namelist variable
out_type_template.

A data container is a string enclosed between <model> and </model> tags.
Data containers must not be split on multiple lines.
No quotation mark must appear in the definition of the data containers.
The enclosed string specifies the data to put at that location.
The enclosed string has the form:
key:key_attributes
Key attributes has the form:
[attribute_name_1=]attribute_value_1, attribute_name_2=attribute_value_2, ...
Blanks within  key:key_attributes  are ignored.
Missing attribute values are supported (equivalent to missing attribute).
The whole string <model>key:key_attributes</model> is replaced in the specified
template by the corresponding value.

Comments, including multi-lines comments, may be defined in the user specified
template; they are enclosed between <!-- and --> tags. No substitution takes
place within a comment.

Field values are produced according to the format defined by 'out_type_fmt'
(default is G13.5). Undefined values are set to the numerical value defined by
'out_type_undefcode'.

Action taken when finding unresolved data container is controled by the value
of out_type_nomatch_action. The default action is to raise an exception, but
these data container can also be ignored or replaced by NA flags. This feature
supports filling TMPL_BASE output by multiple fieldextra calls (e.g. to
generate multi-models products).

This type of output can be used in particular to create XML files (XML comments
are respected, but the XML syntax of the produced file is not checked).

Supported keys and attributes are:

1. Grid point geolocation
    (derived from input data; height in [m], lat/lon in [deg])

            supported values and default values of level_units are described in 4.3.3
            (do not put quotation mark around level_units value!)
            > supported values and default values of level_class are described in 4.3.3

            filter_on_vdate is expressed as a list of hours, between 0 and 24,
            separated by '&'; only validation dates with matching hours are kept
            (e.g. use filter_on_vdate=00&12 to only keep midnight and midday)
            > lead_time_idx refers to the index of the validation time
            (validation times are sorted in increasing values, starting at 1)

Notes:
> In the previous list, model_name refers to the value of default_model_name
    defined in &GlobalSettings.
> For backward compatibility at MeteoSwiss, model_tag can be used in place
    of model_name.


The following options are supported: out_type_snapshot, out_type_template,
out_type_nomatch_action, out_type_fmt, out_type_undefcode, out_type_text1,
out_type_text2, out_type_mapcst, out_type_stdlongitude, out_cost.

The following limitations on the usage of this output are:
> locations list is required
> staggered fields are not supported (re-grid fields if necessary)

.. _section 7.11:

GRIB1 
=====

Generic binary output, based on the WMO FM 92-IX Ext. GRIB specifications.

The following points about handling of undefined (or missing) values have
to be considered: 
> Bitmap section is correctly interpreted in input records (except for 
records originating from ECMWF using the large data set coding, in
which case the corresponding record is skipped and an exception is
raised).
> Bitmap section is never generated in output records. Two approaches
are proposed with fieldextra:
(1) missing values are set to a number which differs from all possible
    values of the field, but which is coded as a normal value in the GRIB 1
    record. The choice of this number is made by the user, by setting
    poper='replace_undef,value' in the last processing iteration. Any
    downstream program using the produced GRIB 1 record has to be
    explicitely configured to interpret the chosen number as a
    missing value flag.
    A drawback of this method is that precision may be lost when
    coding a record with a missing value far away from the range
    of defined values.
(2) missing values are set to a number which is automatically chosen to
    minimize the loss of precision while coding the record, and the missing
    value itself is coded in the local part of the product definition section
    (see section 8.10 for more details). 
    A drawback of this method is that downstream programs have to be
    modified to be aware of this local modification of the GRIB 1 product
    definition section.

For a given field, validation dates for which the field has never been defined
are skipped.

Values of localTablesVersion and masterTablesVersion are set separately,
for each record, and is the maximum of the values found at the following
places: in the input record, in the dictionary, and in the internal 
fieldextra tables.

The following options are supported: out_type_snapshot, out_type_justontime,
out_type_replace, out_type_alternate_name, out_type_template,
out_type_novcoord, out_type_noundef, out_type_dupcst, out_type_mapcst,
out_type_prefered_tunits, out_type_scanmode, out_type_stdlongitude, out_type_toc, 
out_type_packing (can be overriden on a field basis with set_packing),
out_cost.

A GRIB 2 record is generated by ecCodes on the basis of a sample
file (specified by grib2_sample or out_type_template); this sample
file contains a generic GRIB 2 record, filled with dummy or static
values. This file may be used to set some 'exotic' values in the produced
GRIB 2 record. Note however that the choice of the GRIB 2 sample is crucial;
a sample incompatible with ecCodes definition files or with the produced
record may result in a program exception, or, in the worst case, in the
silent production of a bogus record (as a general rule, the shorter the 
sample the better).

The following limitations on the usage of this output are:
> slice not suported
> when a domain subset is specified via a list of grid points or locations,
or a via a frame, or via a non dense rectangle, the output is computed on
the smallest possible compact subdomain containing the specified subset, 
and values at supplementary points are set to undefined.

NETCDF 
======

Generic binary output, based on the Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) and 
the Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Convention, version 1.6 (see
http://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/v1.6.0/cf-conventions.pdf),
with the following additions to the CF conventions:
* dimensions: slice, ensemble perturbation member
* variable attributes: 'ensemble_size', 'short_name', 'vector_basis'

Fields are packed into multi-dimensional arrays. Horizontal dimensions are
either (x,y) or slice, where slice dimension takes values in [0,1] and 
represents the coordinates along a curvilinear segment on the earth.
Up to three other dimensions are supported, namely z, t and the EPS
perturbation number. By default, relevant dimensions are used even if
degenerate (e.g. a single 850hPa level will be packed into an array 
with a z dimension); this behaviour may be modified by setting 
out_type_nodegeneratedim to true. Except for the time dimension and the
slice dimensions which are always unique, multiple dimensions may be defined
in the same output to describe fields defined on different coordinate systems
(e.g. mass point and Arakawa-C grid). No time dimension is associated with
constant fields, and no z dimension is associated with single level fields
(constant and single level characteritics are defined in active dictionary).

Time bounds for time dimension, and the associated field attribute 
'cell_methods', are generated on demand when out_type_timebnds is set
to true. Time bounds are only supported when all fields are defined for
the same time range (for non trivial time range and for all validation 
times separately), and when, for all fields separately, the type of time
range is the same for all validation dates.

Bounds for the z dimension, and the associated field attribute 'cell_methods',
are automatically generated when a field is defined for a layer (i.e. the
spatial extension is specified by two surfaces). Because the type of vertical
reduction used to obtain the layer value is most of the time not known, the 
cell_method value is set to the generic value 'interval' (non CF compliant).

When a field with a slice dimension is coded, the slice variables 'lat', 'lon',
'topo' and 'length' are produced; in particular, the variable 'length' is the
length of the slice from slice start in [m]. Furthermore, if locations are
used to define the slice, labels are generated at the position of the control
points using the location description (as defined in location_list). In this
case, the variable 'label' is produced; this variable takes the value 0 where
no label is available, otherwise it takes for value the index of the label in
the attribute 'labels' of the 'slice' variable. 

A 'units' and 'long_name' attribute is associated with each field, but no
'standard_name'; the long_name and the units are taken from the active
dictionary and may each be re-defined by the user (set_description,
set_units). Also, when distinct from the NetCDF variable name, the field
short name (as defined in the active dictionary) is stored in the attribute
'short_name'.

A 'source' attribute is automatically associated which each field when 
probability related information is present (e.g. probability threshold) or,
when the product category differ from the one defined in the global attribute.
A comment attribute may also be associated with each field (set_comment).

The global attributes 'Conventions', 'ConventionsURL', 'institution',
'source' and 'history' are always present and automatically generated. In
addition, the global attributes 'title' and 'comment' are set to the value
of the namelist variables out_type_text1 and out_type_text2 when present.

The following options are supported: out_type_snapshot, out_type_justontime, 
out_type_nodegeneratedim, out_type_dupcst, out_type_mapcst, 
out_type_noundef, out_type_autoncname, out_type_timebnds, out_type_novcoord,
out_type_ncformat, out_type_ncdeflate, out_type_ncshuffle, out_type_simplenc,
out_type_ncunlimitedtime, out_type_lagranto, out_type_text1, out_type_text2,
out_type_toc, out_type_stdlongitude, out_type_alternate_name, out_type_nousetag,
out_cost.

The following limitations on the usage of this output are:
> when a domain subset is specified via a list of grid points or locations,
or a via a frame, or via a non dense rectangle, the output is computed on
the smallest possible compact subdomain containing the specified subset, 
and values at supplementary points are set to undefined.
