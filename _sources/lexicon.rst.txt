INCORE:       special permanent internal storage, which can be used both as input and 
              output (see 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 8.1)

just on time mode: data is stored and processed independently for each validation
                   date, but order of data in output file respects natural order;
                   automatically triggered if no temporal operators are used and
                   other conditions are satisfied, but can also be explicitely 
                   controlled on an output basis (see 2, 4.3.2, out_type_justontime)
